# learning-travel-site

- Code along project for Brad Schiff's Udemy course

## What I learnt

### Webpack
- Created my first webpack config file.
-- Including many conditionals and variables
-- Also read through the webpack docs to get a better feel for what i was doing, and used the config as a starting point for a project base


### CSS
- More CSS from a different instructor helped cement a lot of things in memory
- BEM notation

### JS
- use of element placeholder variables and really liked Brad's way of using 'clickHandler()' functions to reduce line length and unnamed callbacks
- closing of eventHandlers when no longer needed for performance.
- delayed loading of JS to save initial load

### React
- basic introduction to react

## Netlify
- Introduction to netlify and webhooks.

## Cloud functions
- Introduction to cloud functions and their potential uses.
